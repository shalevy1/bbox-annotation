<p>First, please see the examples below to learn what is considered a good bounding box around an object.</p>
<ul>
<li> If you believe the blue box is not a good box around <b>any</b> object, you can click the 'Click here if not a good box' button. 
</ul>
<p>If the blue box is good, please type in the name of the object within it:</p>
<ul>
<li>In general, the most 'basic' word that comes to mind is good: for example, 'chair', 'car', 'dog' are all good annotations
<li>As you type, the box may autocomplete to offer some suggestions.
<li>Do not be too vague: 'object' or 'thing' are not good annotations.
<li>Do not be too specific (unless you're sure): better to say 'cat' than to incorrectly label a 'Persian cat' as a 'Burmese cat'
<li>Do not enter profanity -- your work will be rejected.
</ul>
