<li>In general, the most 'basic' word that comes to mind is good: for example, 'chair', 'car', 'dog' are all good annotations
<li>Do not be too vague: 'object' or 'thing' are not good annotations.
<li>Do not be too specific (unless you're sure): better to say 'cat' than to incorrectly mention a 'Persian cat' instead of a 'Burmese cat'
<li>Do not enter profanity -- your work will be rejected.
<li>You will not be able to submit if you repeat one of the existing words
</ul>
